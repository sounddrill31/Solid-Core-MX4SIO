# Solid-Core-MX4SIO
DIY Cheap MX4SIO
## Disclaimer:
I DO NOT own a 3d printer or the skills to operate one/order it, hence this project may end up being nothing more than a diagram. However, if you want to make a cheap, easy DIY MX4SIO, and also have the 3d printing skills, let me know via the issues tab.

## How did I get this idea?
I was scrolling through pi pico projects that interface with consoles like the picoboot when one of them caught my eye, called picomemcard. I was intrigued and kept reading on. They mention a person who used cat5 cabling, and 3d printed their own. I found that a wonderful implementation and wanted to port that concept to MX4SIO.
